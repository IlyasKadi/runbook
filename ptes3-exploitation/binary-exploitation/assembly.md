## RAM

Random Access Memory (RAM) is made up of four parts.

| Segment | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stack   | The stack area contains the program stack, a LIFO structure, typically located in the higher parts of memory.                                                           |
| Heap    | Heap is the segment where dynamic memory allocation usually takes place. The heap area begins at the end of the BSS segment and grows to larger addresses from there.   |
| Data    | A data segment is a portion of the virtual address space of a program, which contains the global variables and static variables that are initialized by the programmer. |
| Text    | A text segment is one of the sections of a program in an object file or in memory, which contains executable instructions.                                              |
